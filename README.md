# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub!

I hold a masterâ€™s in applied mathematics and machine learning, and I specialize in building practical solutions for data-driven projects. If you have a tedious workflow, messy datasets, or an idea for AI-powered automation, I can help. I prefer small, focused projects with clear goalsâ€”cleaning a dataset, building a custom dashboard, or integrating an ML model into your existing stack. I keep it simple so you can get real value fast.

**What I do**
- data cleaning & visualization: from raw CSVs or APIs, I parse, transform, and create clear, interactive dashboards.
- AI integration: ChatGPT/LLMs integration for automating repetitive tasks, building prototypes, or enhancing your workflow.
- custom scripting: python or c++ scripts for specialized tasks, from quick prototypes to small-scale proof-of-concepts.
- web dev: sleek, sveltekit-based web apps if you need a frontend to showcase or interact with your data.

**Why me**
- hands-on: I build minimal, effective solutionsâ€”no over-engineering.
- quick turnaround: I focus on smaller scopes first, so we can iterate fast and see results.
- clear explanations: complex doesnâ€™t mean confusing. I make sure you can maintain and scale your solution later.

**Examples**
- health data analysis: iâ€™ve built custom scripts to extract, clean, and visualize apple health data for personal insights.
- hiking data: a map-based visualization that blends geographical and heart data of a long thru-hike.
- milestoneflow: an AI-powered project manager, featuring drag-and-drop tasks, context-aware chatgpt integration, and clean sveltekit design.

If you have a small data project that needs quick results or an idea for an ai prototype, letâ€™s talk. Iâ€™m all about delivering something tangible you can use right away. Email me at pro@rkan.org.
